# dotfiles

The dotfiles for my GNU/Linux systems

## How do I use this?

Clone this repo into your home directory, cd into the dotfiles directory that was created, and use GNU Stow on a subdirectory to create symlinks in the proper places.

-   Much of my Neovim config comes from and is inspired by [christatmachine](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim).
-   The same goes for my Firefox config, which is mostly copied from [noib3](https://github.com/noib3/macOS-dotfiles/tree/master/firefox)
